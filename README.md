# StubCommandControl
This is a command and control application for a remote access tool I developed. The tool itself is not available to the public to prevent it from being used for malicious purposes.
The below screenshots show the command and control interface. The source code for both the remote access tool and the C2 server / GUI are closed source. However potential employers are welcome to enquire and I can give live demonstrations.

The software has been designed as a framework, and thus tools can be added to both the GUI control and the tool with simple implementation into an existing class. The server can support up to 500 connections comfortably but performance struggles after that many concurrent connections. On a private server it could support many more than my laptop.
